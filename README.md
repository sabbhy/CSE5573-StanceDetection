# CSE573-Stance Detection
In this Project we have implemented three algorithms to do the stance detection on Twitter data.
We have used the Sem Eval 2017 task 8 as the dataset.

The three algorithms implemented are : 
1. Support Vector Machine 
2. Recurrant Neural Networks
3. Long Short-Term Memory
